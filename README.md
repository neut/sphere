Sphere
======

Method for obtaining the absolute orientation of a sphere in 3d space.

Method and code was developed during my MSc. studies. A scientific paper was published in Exp. Fluids (2016) as "Translational and rotational dynamics of a large buoyant sphere in turbulence". See [SpringerLink](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00348-016-2136-6) for more information. Paper is also attached in media/ folder.
